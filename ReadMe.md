# Mind The Gap

### Basic gameplay
* Concentration letters at the top
* Word to guess at the bottom
* Selectable number of concentration letters
* Timed rounds based on the number of letters
* Some number of rounds for each level (5?)
* Getting done faster for the level gets more coins
* Shows ads every 10? minutes
* Timer gets shorter for each round
* Can restart the round
* Can pause the round after timer starts
* Stack of words successfully guessed
* Wrong guesses have a time penalty
* Trying to select another letter guess too fast shows lock icon

### Words
* list: https://github.com/raun/Scrabble/blob/master/words.txt
* Use words 5 to 10 letters long
* Allow similar word guesses to be right

### Peeking
* Initial peek is 5 seconds?
* Costs coins
* More peeks cost higher coin values

### Purchases (just coins)
* Buy time/peeks
* Remove ads

### Interface
* UI ($36 for the year): https://craftpix.net/product/iconmania-2d-game-kit/?num=1&count=32&sq=words&pos=4
